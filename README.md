**Sentiment Analysis Using Roberta**
This code is used to demonstrate the application of the RoBERTa model for sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews. Sentiment analysis is the task of determining the sentiment or opinion expressed in a piece of text, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. In the context of restaurant reviews, sentiment analysis can be valuable for understanding customer opinions and feedback.

The code first loads a dataset of restaurant reviews and performs some initial exploratory data analysis to visualize the distribution of positive and negative reviews. It then applies basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition, to showcase some of the capabilities of the NLTK library.

Next, the code introduces the RoBERTa model, a powerful pre-trained language model specifically designed for various NLP tasks. It utilizes the transformers library, which provides an interface to use pre-trained models like RoBERTa. The model is initialized and used to classify the sentiment of a given restaurant review.

By running this code, one can gain insights into how sentiment analysis can be performed using the RoBERTa model, enabling the extraction of sentiment information from restaurant reviews automatically. This can be useful for businesses to understand customer satisfaction levels, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions based on customer feedback.
